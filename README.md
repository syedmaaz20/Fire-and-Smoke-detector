# Project Title: Fire and Smoke Detection Using CNN with Keras

Project Description:

This project focuses on developing an intelligent Fire and Smoke Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with the Keras deep learning library. The primary objective is to create a real-time detection system that can accurately identify fire and smoke from images or video feeds, potentially serving as an early warning system for fire hazards in various environments.

Key Features:

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a CNN architecture to automatically learn and extract features from images, distinguishing fire and smoke from other objects.

Real-time Detection: The model is designed to work in real-time environments, providing instant feedback to prevent potential disasters.

Dataset: A custom dataset of fire and smoke images is collected from various sources, including open datasets, and is augmented to improve the model's robustness against different environments and lighting conditions.

Key Applications:

Fire Safety in Buildings: Can be integrated into surveillance systems to detect fire or smoke early in buildings, offices, or factories.

Forest Fire Detection: Useful for detecting early signs of forest fires in outdoor environments through drones or satellite imagery.

Smart Cities: Can be a critical component of smart city infrastructures, ensuring quick responses to fire hazards in public spaces.


# Conclusion:

The Fire and Smoke Detection System is an AI-based solution aimed at providing accurate and reliable detection of fire and smoke to reduce response time and mitigate damage in fire-related incidents. The project leverages CNN's feature extraction capabilities along with Kerasâ€™s flexibility for fast and effective model development.
